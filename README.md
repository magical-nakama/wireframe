The basic outline for a custom Wordpress theme.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About this project:

I am developing this theme to power a professional blog / portfolio. 
In the absence of any specific design plan I have chosen to focus on getting the general layout and functionality in place before making design changes.

There are three intended functions to this site at the index level.

The main blog Loop will output the three most recent posts categorised as "primary". When there are sufficient posts to warrant it there will also be an Archive page that will maintain a list of posts ordered by other categories attached to them.

The "About Me" blurb will contain basic information about myself and link to a larger static page containing an extended CV.

The "Portfolio" section will list the titles of five recent project related posts (categorised as "portfolio") and link to their individual pages.
